In the book Sapiens, written by Yuval Noah Harari, chapter Imperial Visions 2. Yuval Noah Harari explains and educates the reader on the history of Empires and their significance throughout human history. The book was first published in Hebrew year 2011 and later published in English format year 2014.
It appears that Empire is the most common form of government or at least it has been in the last 2500 years and we might all derive from an ancient empire and to my suprise Yuval Noah Harari says that it's also the most stable form of government. Yuval Noah Harari says that an empire must have two characteristics. An empire must rule over a large number of people with different cultures and historical backgrounds. An empire must also be able to incorporate new territories and cultures without any disruption in the core structure of the empire. And the new land or culture does not necessarily have to be conquered with force and bloodshed. An empire can conquer a land or people by simply saying that they will benefit greatly from being apart of the empire. Yuval mentions India as an example of this who was conquered by the british empire. The Brits built their railroad network and India is still a democracy to this day. Empires are also great for merging many small distinct cultures into larger cultures and thus also dealing with humans tendency to divide people into us who we care about and those who we don't care about. If people belong to the same empire they can unite behind the common goal of the empire instead of being hostile and prejudice towards the unkown enemy.
